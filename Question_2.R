# Suppose a drug company develops a new drug to prevent colds. The company states thatthe drug is equally effective for men and women. 
# To test this claim, they choose a simplerandom sample of100women and200men from a population. 
# At the end of the study,38% of the women caught a cold; and51%of the men caught a cold. Based on these findings, write down the R programming code to test whether the 
# companyâ€™s claim thatthe drug is equally effective for men and women at 99% level of confidence?
